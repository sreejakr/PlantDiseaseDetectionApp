# Plant Disease Detection App

This web application utilizes deep learning techniques to detect plant diseases from images of plant leaves. It provides users with instant diagnosis and treatment recommendations, helping farmers and gardeners identify and manage plant health issues effectively.
The ipynb file has the code for the Deep Learning model.

## Features:

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of plant leaves directly through the web interface.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Upon image upload, the app performs real-time prediction using a pre-trained deep learning model to identify the disease.
- **Diagnosis and Treatment:** The app provides detailed diagnosis information about the detected disease and offers treatment recommendations to manage it.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- **Educational Content:** Additionally, the app educates users about various plant diseases and their management strategies, contributing to increased awareness and knowledge in plant health management.

## Technologies Used:

- **Flask:** The web application is built using Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
- **TensorFlow:** TensorFlow is used for training and deploying the deep learning model for plant disease detection.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend development technologies are used to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The Python model notebook is provided for transparency and reproducibility, allowing users to explore the model architecture and training process.

## Usage:

1. **Upload Image:** Select an image of a plant leaf using the provided upload button.
2. **View Diagnosis:** After uploading the image, the app displays the predicted disease and provides detailed diagnosis information.
3. **Explore Treatment:** Users can explore treatment recommendations to manage the detected disease effectively.

## Note:

- The deep learning model used in this application is trained on a dataset of plant images labeled with various diseases.
- The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python model is included for transparency and educational purposes. Users can explore the model architecture and training process in detail.
